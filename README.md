✅ Multi Currency Expense Engine – Backend
Project Overview

Multi Currency Expense Engine is a Node.js + Express backend service designed for foreign interns and international students who share expenses across different countries. The system allows users to record payments in their own currency and automatically calculates balances, debts, and settlements using secure financial algorithms.

Problem Statement:-

When people from multiple countries live or work together:
One pays rent in EUR
Another pays food in CAD
Another pays travel in INR
Manual splitting becomes confusing and unfair due to currency differences and timezones.
➡ This backend solves that by providing automatic conversion and debt simplification with minimum transfers.
